The Table Tennis Club is part of the <a href="https://clubsports.mit.edu/">MIT Sports Club Council</a>. We are devoted to providing an environment in which members can play both competitively and recreationally.
<p>The club offers members 14 quality Butterfly Europa Tables that are in very good condition. In addition, a large number of balls and a few very basic rackets are available for practice, although we highly encourage members to bring their own rackets to practice. The club also has a 'Robo Pong' robot to help with team practice sessions.</p>
<p> For Spring 2022, the club has open recreational practice sessions twice a week and a team-only practice session once a week. We encourage members to take advantage of the sessions.
A full schedule can be found <a href="PracticeSchedule.html"> here</a>.
In addition, the club offers quality coaching to its members under the guidance of Coach David Alfonso,
<!-- Carlos Espinoza-Toro. Carlos is an ITTF Level 1 certified Table Tennis coach.
	He will be coming every Saturday to handle the training of the club members as well as the intercollegiate team. He will be assisted by Coach Alex Landsman, -->
who will come periodically to handle the training of club members.</p>

<p>In addition to recreational playing, the club also hosts the competitive MIT table tennis teams that participates in the National Collegiate Table Tennis Association (NCTTA) tournaments every year.
The MIT team has done very well at the divisional level over the last couple of years. 
The women's team advanced to the regionals during the 2017-18 season, while the coed team came in at 3rd place during the 2017-18 season and at 2nd place in 2016-17. 
<!-- For the Fall 2019 semester, team practices are held two times a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays and consist of various drills and excercises along with multi-ball training with our team officers Tzyy-Shyang (John) and Jie.--> 
</p>
<p>In addition, the club holds two large tournaments every year that are open to the general public. We encourage all those interested in playing competitively to register for these tournaments. Information regarding upcoming tournaments can be found <a href="Tournament.html"> here</a></p>
<p>I encourage you to browse through our website. Please feel free to email any questions to tt-officers@mit.edu</p>

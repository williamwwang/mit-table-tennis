<p align="justify"><strong>Am I allowed to join the MIT Table Tennis Club?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">We welcome any MIT students, faculty, staff, alumni, affiliates, and their families of all skill levels. You will need an MIT athletics card or an equivalent in order to access our practice facilities. For card information, you can visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://mitrecsports.com/membership-pass-types/default.aspx">MIT Department of Recreation</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br /> If you do not fall in one of the above categories, then unfortunately you will not be allowed to join the club. This is due to the rules set by the MIT Club Sports Council.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>What do I have to do to join the MIT Table Tennis Club?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">It&rsquo;s simple, download and sign the waiver form (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/clubsports/officers/waivers.shtml">http://web.mit.edu/clubsports/officers/waivers.shtml</a>) and submit it to a coach during the next practice.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any membership fees associated with joining the club?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">No.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>What equipment do you provide for club members?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">We have 14 Butterfly Europa tables with nets. We also provide practice balls and paddles if you do not have your own.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>What equipment should I bring to the club?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">If you have your own paddle, please bring it. Also, please wear appropriate shoes and sports attire.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Can you tell me about coaching at the MIT Table Tennis Club?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Our primary coach, Coach Liang Liung, is a USATT certified coach who has experience instructing players of all skill levels. Team coach Carlos Espinoza-Toro specializes in training the MIT team for intercollegiate competition. They are assisted by Coach Alex Landsman. During club hours, you may approach any of the coaches and ask to practice with them (the cost is covered by the club). If there are other members waiting, please limit your time with a coach.

<p align="justify"><strong>What happens if there are not enough tables to accommodate all players?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Please be aware of other players while you are at the club. Consider stepping down from your table after you have played for a while if there are others waiting. If you are waiting, you can ask people playing on a table if you can play the winner, or if you are with a friend, you can ask if you can use the table afterwards.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>I would like to buy my own paddle. What should I do?</strong></p>

We are part of the New England Division which includes universities such as Brown, BU, Harvard, Northeastern, etc. The team is made up of 8 players to maintain a healthy roster.
